If you’re looking for pee jokes, urine luck! Sorry, that was a bit of a foul joke, but not as foul as the situation that results from failing to find a restroom in time when you’re out and about. This is especially an issue in overcrowded urban areas such as New York and San Francisco, and many public restrooms in these cities have hard-to-obtain access codes. With our service text2go, you can text our number and receive a short list of nearby open public bathrooms and their codes. We added a lighthearted touch by sending a cheeky pun with our text as well as recommending a random song from our personalized bathroom Spotify playlist.
